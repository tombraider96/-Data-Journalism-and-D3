          <h2>2014 U.S. State Data Demonstrates Relationship Between Health Markers and Poverty Levels</h2>
          <p>To visualize different data views, please select from the various headings of Poverty, Age, Household Income, 
            Obesity, Smokers, and Without Healthcare. Each selection shifts the State data represented in circles on  
            the graph. The small circles can then be selected or hovered over to view the specific values for that state.  </p>

          <p>This data is older, 2014, but still relevant in demonstrating relatedness to the markers being measured. You can 
            see that when selecting poverty and absence of healthcare you find two extremes.  Texas, at the top of the graph, 
            having a poverty rate of 17.2 % with 24.9 % without healthcare and Massechusetts having a poverty rate of 11.6 % 
            but 4% rate without healthcare. For additional background, Google, Massechusetts and healthcare, you find that in 
            2006, healthcare reform was passed into law with the aim to provide coverage to 100% of it's residents. It would 
            be interesting to find the poverty level in Massechusetts prior to 2006, to see if this coverage helped improve 
            the rate of poverty there.  A Google search of Texas finds that even in 2019, with one of the highest participating 
            rates in Healthcare.gov (over 1 million), that the rate of participation drops each year and that Texas has taken
            legal action against the ACA. </p>

          <p>If you shift the view again, selecting age instead of poverty, you will note that the majority of those without 
            healthcare are in the 35 - 45 age range.  But you will also find, that selection of obesity and smokers doesn't shift
            the average age range by much at all!  The average age of all this data from 2014 seems to fall within that range. 
            Please use this graph to shift the views and reflect on what you see.  Do you see any relationship between the data 
            points represented?  Next article we will dig deeper into the relationship between the data points.   </p>
